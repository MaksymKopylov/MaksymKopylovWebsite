Substantially, I am interested in housing policy and political economy of the welfare state.\nThere are several topics that I explore in-depth. Firstly, for my term paper, I conduct research on rent regulation in European welfare states. And secondly, I also study citizens’ preferences towards home ownership vis-à-vis renting and how they affect housing policy."

I am an active activist in this field, promoting briding as citizen science, advocating for more bird feeders in the parks and for more responsible behaviour towards birds living around us.\n\n\n\nThat is Eurasian Linnet, this bird is a rather rare one in Ukraine, but many Linnets live side-by-side with humans who are not even aware of them!"
