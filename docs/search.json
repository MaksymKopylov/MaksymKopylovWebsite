Substantially, I am interested in housing policy and political economy of the welfare state.\nThere are several topics that I explore in-depth. Firstly, for my term paper, I conduct research on rent regulation in European welfare states. And secondly, I also study citizens’ preferences towards home ownership vis-à-vis renting and how they affect housing policy."
