Hi, I am Maksym Kopylov, an aspiring human being and a social policy analyst. Even though I don't know much in my field, I am eager to learn! Here you can have a look at my research interests, projects, and other important stuff.

## Research interests

I absolutely love public policy analysis and mixed methods research. Substantially, I am interested in housing policy and political economy of the welfare state.

There are several topics that I explore in-depth. Firstly, for my term paper, I conduct research on rent regulation in European welfare states. And secondly, I also study citizens' preferences towards home ownership vis-Ã -vis renting and how they affect housing policy.

## Current projects

### 1. MITACS Globalink Research Internship

I am currently involved in a research project on nurse migration pathways at Wilfrid Laurier University - Waterloo.

## Biridng

I am a keen on bird-watching. In Ukraine I have already spotted 87 different species of birds. I am an active activist in this field, promoting briding as citizen science, advocating for more bird feeders in the parks and for more responsible behaviour towards birds living around us.
